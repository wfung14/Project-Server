# Into The Queue

## Description
For my full-stack application, I've decided to make a movie tracker. This is essentially a list to keep track of what movies a person hasn't seen and wants to watch in the future. This can also be used to put movies on the list that a person has seen and wants to watch again. Once the user has watched their chosen movie, they'll be able to remove it from the list.
